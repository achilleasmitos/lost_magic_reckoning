END USER (PLAYER) INSTRUCTIONS

Thank you for downloading our game! We hope you have fun playing it,
so much that you will share it with your friends, and let us know about it!
In case something is wrong with it or with the installation, don't hesitate to contact us
via GitHub!

Speaking of installation, this game has none! You have already downloaded the zip file and
extracted it, so you are done! Feel free to open the executable and start playing.

What you CAN DO:
- You can change the contents of any file in this folder (and any subfolder), but
keep in mind that this might affect the game in weird ways. Be certain of what you are doing,
before doing it.
- You can add files in this folder (and you probably want to, at some point). Again,
be sure of what you are doing and why.
- You can create a shortcut of the exe, place it anywhere on your PC, and play from there.
You can move it, rename it, delete it, and generally do anything you wish with that shortcut.
- You can move this folder anywhere on your PC: your Downloads, your Games, or even
your Program Files. It doesn't matter where this folder is, as long as its contents
follow the rules described here.

What you CANNOT DO:
- You cannot rename or delete any file in here. This might lead to unexpected behavior
from the game, which is undesirable for both you and us.
- You cannot move files around, and you cannot change the folder structure.
This is similar to the point above.

HAPPY GAMING!
