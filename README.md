# text-adventure

A repository for a text-based, choose-your-own-path type of adventure game. Built using C++.
It is used mainly as a learning project for a couple of close friends to brush up on their C++ knowledge.

## Developing

The first thing for someone to do in order to participate in the development of this repository is to check the Documentation folder, where they can find useful things such as the naming convention, and the code format that we use.
