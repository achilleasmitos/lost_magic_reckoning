# Lost Magic: Reckoning

A repository for a text-based, choose-your-own-path type of adventure game. Built using C++.
It is used mainly as a learning project for a couple of close friends to brush up on their C++ knowledge.

## Developing

The first thing for someone to do in order to participate in the development of this repository is to check the Documentation folder, where they can find useful things such as the naming convention, and the code format that we use. In order to submit their desire to participate in our project, look at the Discussions page of the repo.

### Getting Started

In order to start developing the game, you first need to download Git from their [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Clone our repository locally, then head over to [VSCode's website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) to download the code editor. Next, you wanna read up on how to get started with the development of C++ and VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp). Simply follow their steps up until you have verified that the commands for `gcc --version`, `gdb --version` and `g++ --version` work as intended. **Important!** We are using the MinGW-x64 compiler for Windows, so it's best you follow their example on that page; it has everything you need for that (no need to do what the compiler's website actually tells you to do). _Bonus_: You may also build a simple 'Hello World' program if you wanna be extra sure that everything's in order. You are now done! Open our (cloned) repository in VSCode, and build the project (hit `Ctrl + Shift + B`, or click on Terminal -> Run Build Task). Once you have successfully built (and run the produced executable) at least once, you may proceed with the usual development processes of assigning an item to yourself, checking out a new branch, opening a PR and so on... _Note_: If you haven't used Git before, the first time you try to push something to our repository, you will be asked for your name and email; please fill them in as necessary.

## Playing the game

Once you download the latest zip file found on our pages, you simply need to extract it anywhere, then run the executable found within (no other installation required). If you feel like it, create a shortcut for the executable, so that you can access it from anywhere with a double click!
Also, be sure to checkout out the instructions found within the downloaded folder. They provide useful guidance on things you can and cannot do.

If something is missing from the instructions and the game itself, check out our documentations folder, for we might not have included it in the release folder.
