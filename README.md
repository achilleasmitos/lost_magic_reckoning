# Lost Magic: Reckoning

A repository for a text-based, choose-your-own-path type of adventure game. Built using C++.
It is used mainly as a learning project for a couple of close friends to brush up on their C++ knowledge.

## Developing

The first thing for someone to do in order to participate in the development of this repository is to check the Documentation folder, where they can find useful things such as the naming convention, and the code format that we use. In order to submit their desire to participate in our project, look at the Discussions page of the repo.

## Playing the game

Once you download the latest zip file found on our pages, you simply need to extract it anywhere, then run the executable found within (no other installation required). If you feel like it, create a shortcut for the executable, so that you can access it from anywhere with a double click!
Also, be sure to checkout out the instructions found within the downloaded folder. They provide useful guidance on things you can and cannot do.

If something is missing from the instructions and the game itself, check out our documentations folder, for we might not have included it in the release folder.
