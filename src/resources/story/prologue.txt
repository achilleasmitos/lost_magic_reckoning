A small sun ray manages to find its way through the grate that serves as your window,
hitting your closed eyes and signaling the coming of a new morning. You slowly come to.

Your head feels heavy, and your whole body aches as if after a long day's labor.
You open your eyes, only to find yourself lain down on a cold, hard, stone floor
of a cell that barely fits your height. Right next to you lies also a man
in his 40s, dark beard and hair filled with muck.
He won't move. After inspecting him, you realize that he has probably been dead
for the better part of the night, if not for longer.

A loud bang on the cell's bars jostles you. You see a guard dressed in blacks,
with a silver breastplate, helm and spear in his hand, staring down at you.
- "Come on sleeping beauty, it's time for your match!" he barks at you.
Your ears are ringing from the loud noises of the bars and this man's voice.
What match? What is he talking about? Where are you, and why can't you remember a thing?

The guard unlocks your tiny cell that reeks of urine and booze, grabs your arm
with his free hand and props you up. It is hard enough to even stand on your own feet,
let alone follow him down the corridor that he leads you.
Almost in a daze, you manage to pull through, finally arriving at a room
behind a closed wooden door with weapons and armor on racks.

The guard waits for you for a good ten seconds, before deciding to pick something
in your stead. It's a worn-out leather armor that fits you surprisingly well,
a small round wooden shield, and a steel sword that has seen better days.
He helps you (if help it is) put on the armor, then buckles the shield to your left arm.
Handing you the sword too, he pushes you towards the exit and right to another corridor.

Soon enough, you find yourself before a sturdy wooden door,
slightly bigger than the one you just came through. You look behind
to ask the man some questions now that your head has sort of cleared up,
but he is missing.

You hear a couple of steel bars sliding, and the door opens.

You squint your eyes at the morning sun staring down your face,
while the voices and cheers of what seems to be hundreds upon hundreds of people
flood your senses. As if enchanted, you take a step forward, then another, and another.
The gate behind you shuts and locks, leaving you standing on one end
of an oval-shaped stadium with a fine yellowish dirt ground.
Around you, there are indeed lots of people sitting in rows, filling the space
with a terrible ruckus. You want to take a minute and study their faces,
which all now look completely unfamiliar to you, but there is no time.

Across the stadium, there stands a hulking beast, with hoofed legs,
dark brown fur, two horns on its bull-like head, and a great battle-axe in his hands.
It digs the ground twice with its left hoof, then lets out an intimidating moan
and charges at you!

The last strike sends you flying backwards, and you find yourself lying
with your back on the dirt floor. Your head is aching as blood streams down your face,
impeding your vision. There is a deathly silence in the large stadium;
everybody is holding their breath. The minotaur approaches you and lifts
his axe to deal the final blow.

There is a sudden flash of green behind the beast. Something seems to hit it
in the back. The minotaur's skin starts turning grey, as if stone, but quickly
it crumbles into fine dust. Two seconds later, there is nothing left of your opponent
or his gear; only a pile of ash at your feet.

Panic breaks out in the stadium as everybody realizes that somebody had used magic
(and a powerful one, for sure) to turn the tide of battle. People start evacuating
the premises, afraid of what might come next.

You feel a hand touch your shoulder. You turn your head to see a hooded man
with blue eyes and a black well-trimmed beard kneeling above you.
You experience a weird sickness, like you've just lost the ground beneath you.
You close your eyes momentarily, and when you reopen them, you and the hooded man
are in the countryside, quite a long way from the city walls.

- "You are badly wounded, but I believe you can stand on your feet" the man says,
and props you up. "Come, I have a mission for you, and it's best you start
walking; the journey is long" he then adds.
- "Sorry, do we know each other?" you mutter bewildered.
- "I knew your father, he was a good man" he answers back. "You have to avenge him".
- "My father? I... I can't remember my father's name, or his face, or anything..." you
respond, rubbing your blooded head with your hand. "I must have suffered a concussion".

The man suddenly pauses and takes an inquiring look at the whole of you.
He then makes a circling motion with his hands on your torso and mutters
some arcane words beneath his breath. When he finishes, he says:
- "It is not a simple concussion that you have. This amnesia has been inflicted
upon you. Change of plans then".
- "What plans?" you ask, still confounded by this encounter with the blue eyed man.
- "We need to heal you of this memory loss. You are going to Slyrun!"
