The last strike sends you flying backwards, and you find yourself lying
with your back on the dirt floor. Your head is aching as blood streams down your face,
impeding your vision. There is a deathly silence in the large stadium;
everybody is holding their breath. The minotaur approaches you and lifts
his axe to deal the final blow.

There is a sudden flash of green behind the beast. Something seems to hit it
in the back. The minotaur's skin starts turning grey, as if stone, but quickly
it crumbles into fine dust. Two seconds later, there is nothing left of your opponent
or his gear; only a pile of ash at your feet.

Panic breaks out in the stadium as everybody realizes that somebody had used magic
(and a powerful one, for sure) to turn the tide of battle. People start evacuating
the premises, afraid of what might come next.

You feel a hand touch your shoulder. You turn your head to see a hooded man
with blue eyes and a black well-trimmed beard kneeling above you.
You experience a weird sickness, like you've just lost the ground beneath you.
You close your eyes momentarily, and when you reopen them, you and the hooded man
are in the countryside, quite a long way from the city walls.

- "You are badly wounded, but I believe you can stand on your feet" the man says,
and props you up. "Come, I have a mission for you, and it's best you start
walking; the journey is long" he then adds.
- "Sorry, do we know each other?" you mutter bewildered.
- "I knew your father, he was a good man" he answers back. "You have to avenge him".
- "My father? I... I can't remember my father's name, or his face, or anything..." you
respond, rubbing your blooded head with your hand. "I must have suffered a concussion".

The man suddenly pauses and takes an inquiring look at the whole of you.
He then makes a circling motion with his hands on your torso and mutters
some arcane words beneath his breath. When he finishes, he says:
- "It is not a simple concussion that you have. This amnesia has been inflicted
upon you. Change of plans then".
- "What plans?" you ask, still confounded by this encounter with the blue eyed man.
- "We need to heal you of this memory loss. You are going to Slyrun!"
